Sequence generatio: For random sequence generation since the say they enumerated all households and then simply went with every other household receiving vaccine or placebo, this seems OK to me. I def don’t think this is high risk of bias and would be happy with low risk (preferable) or unclear. If unclear, would be useful to state what details we would have wanted that would give us more assurance. 

Attrition bias:  I assume attrition here is really just about migration. Given how short the study was, I can’t imagine the risk is high that there is (1) a lot of migration and (2) that it would be differential between vaccinees and their placebo neighbors. I would go with low risk."
